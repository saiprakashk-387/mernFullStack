          The main purpose of using MERN stack is to develop apps using
          JavaScript only. This is because the four technologies that make up
          the technology stack are all JS-based. Thus, if one knows JavaScript
          (and JSON), the backend, frontend, and database can be operated
          easily.
        </li>
      </ul>
